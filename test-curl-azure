The sun was bright and shining just behind the stoplight. This made it hard to see the lights. There was a car on my left in the left turn lane. A few moments later another car, a black sedan pulled up behind me. When the left turn light changed green, the black sedan hit me thinking that the light had changed for us, but I had not moved because the light was still red. After hitting my car, the black sedan backed up and then sped past me.I did manage to catch its license plate. The license plate of the black sedan was ABC123."}' http://nltk.azurewebsites.net
